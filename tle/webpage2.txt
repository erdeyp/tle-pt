<b> <i> Air Pollution </i> </b> </font></center>

<p align="center">
<font color="black", size="5", face="Times New Roman">
Air pollution, the release of different gases into the atmosphere,
<br> 
finely divided solids, or finely dispersed liquid aerosols at amounts 
<br>
above the normal dissipation and dilution or absorption potential of 
<br>
the environment. These substances can exceed air concentrations that 
<br>
cause unwanted health, economic, or aesthetic effects. </font></center>

<b> <i> Sources of Air Pollution </i> </b> </font></center>

<p align="center">
<font color="black", size="5", face="Times New Roman">
<b> <i> “Mobile Sources” </i> </b>
<br>
include motor vehicles, marine vessels, aircraft and the effect of sound etc.
<br>
<b> <i> "Chemicals" </i> </b>
<br>
Chemicals, dust and controlled burn practices in agriculture and forestry management.
<br>
<b> <i>"Stationary Sources" </i> </b>
<br>
include smoke stacks of power plants, manufacturing facilities (factories)
<br>
and waste incinerators, as well as furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices.

<b> <i> Types of Air Pollutants </i> </b> </font></center>

<p align="center">
<font color="black", size="5", face="Times New Roman">
<b> <i> Nitrogen oxides (NOx): </i> </b>
<br>
Especially nitrogen dioxide are emitted from high temperature combustion. 
<br>
Nitrogen dioxide is the chemical compound with the formula N02. It is 
<br>
responsible for photochemical smog, acid rain etc.
<br>
<b> <i> Carbon dioxide (CO2): </i> </b>
<br>
A greenhouse gas emitted from combustion but is also a gas vital to 
<br>
living organisms. It is a natural gas in the atmosphere
<br>
<b> <i> Carbon monoxide: </i> </b>
<br>
It is a colourless, odourless, non-irritating but very poisonous gas. It 
<br>
is a product by incomplete combustion of fuel such as natural gas, coal 
<br>
or wood. Vehicular exhaust is a major source of carbon monoxide. </font></center>

<b> <i> Effects of Air Pollution </i> </b> </font></center>

<p align="center">
<font color="black", size="5", face="Times New Roman">
A number of adverse health effects can be caused by exposure to 
<br>
high levels of air pollution. It raises the risk of lung cancer, heart 
<br>
disease and respiratory infections. There have been health risks 
<br>
associated with both short and long-term exposure to air pollutants. People
<br> 
who are already sick are affected by more serious consequences. 
<br>
Infants, elderly people and poor people are more affected. </font></center>
