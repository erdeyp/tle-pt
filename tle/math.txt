The drawing shows hope and freedom, as you can see the hands breaks free
<br>
from the chain and is reaching for the bird symbolizing freedom. Just like
<br>
this pandemic, one day we will break free from all the hardship were
<br>
experiencing right now and reach the freedom we need, we just need to have
<br>
faith and be hopeful. In other words freedom is always present in those times
<br>
you felt there is no one beside you and there is a person who control your life 
<br>
and they are the one who decide for the better we need to have freedom 
<br>
we choose,we decide for our own life. </font></center>
